This module did not exist in 0.8.28. See the following notes about the mono-repo migration

# Mono Repo Migration

Before 0.8.29, cluser_tools did not exist in this repository. Instead, v1.1 to v1.61 were maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/scalableminds/cluster_tools/releases).
Note that 0.8.29 is newer than 1.61.
The poor naming was a sacrifice during the mono-repo migration which enforced synchronized versioning between all packages (e.g., wkcuber and webknossos).
To avoid version conflicts in the future, the first major release for webknossos-libs will be v2.
