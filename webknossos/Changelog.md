### Breaking Changes
### Added
### Changed
- The `Vec3Int` constructor now asserts that its components are whole numbers also in numpy case. [#434](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/434)
- Updated scikit-image dependency to 0.18.3. [#435](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/435)
### Fixed

## [0.8.16](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-cuber/releases/tag/v0.8.16) - 2021-09-22
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-cuber/compare/v0.8.15...v0.8.16)

### Breaking Changes
- Refactored the BufferedSliceWriter and added a BufferedSliceReader. [#425](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/425)
  - BufferedSliceWriter
    - The data no longer gets transposed: previously the format of the slices was [y,x]; now it is [x,y]
    - The interface of the constructor was changed:
      - A `View` (or `MagView`) is now required as datasource
      - The parameter `dimension` can be used to specify the axis along the data is sliced
      - The offset is expected to be in the magnification of the view
    - This class is now supposed to be used within a context manager and the slices are written by sending them to the generator (see documentation of the class).
  - BufferedSliceReader
    - This class was added complementary to the BufferedSliceWriter
  - Added methods to get a BufferedSliceReader/BufferedSliceWriter from a View directly

### Breaking Changes

- Breaking changes were introduced for geometry classes in [#421](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/421):
  - `BoundingBox`
    - is now immutable, use convenience methods, e.g. `bb.with_topleft((0,0,0))`
    - properties topleft and size are now Vec3Int instead of np.array, they are each immutable as well
    - all `to_`-conversions return a copy, some were renamed:
    - `to_array` → `to_list`
    - `as_np` → `to_np`
    - `as_wkw` → `to_wkw_dict`
    - `from_wkw` → `from_wkw_dict`
    - `as_config` → `to_config_dict`
    - `as_checkpoint_name` → `to_checkpoint_name`
    - `as_tuple6` → `to_tuple6`
    - `as_csv` → `to_csv`
    - `as_named_tuple` → `to_named_tuple`
    - `as_slices` → `to_slices`
    - `copy` → (gone, immutable)

  - `Mag`
    - is now immutable
    - `mag.mag` is now `mag._mag` (considered private, use to_list instead if you really need it as list)
    - all `to_`-conversions return a copy, some were renamed:
    - `to_array` → `to_list`
    - `scale_by` → (gone, immutable)
    - `divide_by` → (gone, immutable)
    - `as_np` → `to_np`

### Added

 - An immutable Vec3Int class was introduced that holds three integers and provides a number of convenience methods and accessors. [#421](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/421)

### Changed

- `BoundingBox` and `Mag` are now immutable attr classes containing `Vec3Int` values. See breaking changes above.

### Fixed

-
