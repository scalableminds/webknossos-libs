### Breaking Changes

- Breaking changes were introduced for geometry classes in [#421](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/421):
  - `BoundingBox`
    - is now immutable, use convenience methods, e.g. `bb.with_topleft((0,0,0))`
    - properties topleft and size are now Vec3Int instead of np.array, they are each immutable as well
    - all `to_`-conversions return a copy, some were renamed:
    - `to_array` → `to_list`
    - `as_np` → `to_np`
    - `as_wkw` → `to_wkw_dict`
    - `from_wkw` → `from_wkw_dict`
    - `as_config` → `to_config_dict`
    - `as_checkpoint_name` → `to_checkpoint_name`
    - `as_tuple6` → `to_tuple6`
    - `as_csv` → `to_csv`
    - `as_named_tuple` → `to_named_tuple`
    - `as_slices` → `to_slices`
    - `copy` → (gone, immutable)

  - `Mag`
    - is now immutable
    - `mag.mag` is now `mag._mag` (considered private, use to_list instead if you really need it as list)
    - all `to_`-conversions return a copy, some were renamed:
    - `to_array` → `to_list`
    - `scale_by` → (gone, immutable)
    - `divide_by` → (gone, immutable)
    - `as_np` → `to_np`

### Added

 - An immutable Vec3Int class was introduced that holds three integers and provides a number of convenience methods and accessors. [#421](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-libs/pull/421)

### Changed

- `BoundingBox` and `Mag` are now immutable attr classes containing `Vec3Int` values. See breaking changes above.

### Fixed

-
