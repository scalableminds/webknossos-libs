# Teams and Users

This example uses the [`User` class](../../api/webknossos/administration/user.md#webknossos.administration.user.User) and the [`Team` class](../../api/webknossos/administration/user.md#webknossos.administration.user.Team) to access information about the current user, all managed users and all teams this user is in. It also shows how to add a new team and assign a user as a team manager.
