# Announce manual Dataset upload

This example demonstrates the manual process of uploading a Dataset. If users have file-system access to the WEBKNOSSOS datastore, they can upload a dataset by manually copying it to the binary_data folder. To ensure proper database entry creation and access rights, the Dataset can be announced using the WEBKNOSSOS API.
